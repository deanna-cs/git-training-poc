# Hugo Starter

This is another Hugo SSG starter project.
This one is a bit different than others I have found in that it will also have the following tools/tech/services setup too.

* [Hugo Site Generator](https://gohugo.io/)
* [GitPod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/)
* [FrontMatter VS Code Extension](https://frontmatter.codes/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

With some some example layouts, partials and shortcodes to demo some common Hugo features.

* Design Blocks
  * Block Partials
  * Compatible front matter
* Tables from Data files
* Section List Pages
* Custom Layouts by 'Type'
* Using Built-in and Custom Shortcodes
* Dynamic Navigation Menu for Site Sections
* Basic Site Search

If you have any questions/problems/suggestions, please feel free to open an issue in this project.
